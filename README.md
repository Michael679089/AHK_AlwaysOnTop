# AHK_AlwaysOnTop

> ðŸ’¡ **NOTE:** To make this work, first install [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/). Next Download and run the exe, or download the AHK script to directly run the source code

## Description
An application that I created to make an application or program to stay on top of the other windows. 

### Reason for Making
While there are other applications that already created a version of this, I want to make my own to practice coding with AutoHotKey. I use this to make my browser/applications stay on top of other windows while I join meetings or watch YouTube videos, example of this is me using a note-taking webapp called Notion while in classroom zoom meetings.

## Features:
1. It can toggle the program's windows to be Always On Top.
2. It can toggle on/off.
3. Always On Top windows will stay on Top of every window active on screen.
