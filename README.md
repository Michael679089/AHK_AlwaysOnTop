# AHK_AlwaysOnTop

An application that I created to make an application or program to stay on top of the other windows. I use this so that I can make my browser/applications stay on top of other windows while I join meetings or watch YouTube videos, example of this is me using a note-taking webapp called Notion while watching the class meeting.

Features:
1. It can toggle the program's windows to be Always On Top.
2. It can toggle on/off.
3. Always On Top windows will stay on Top of every window active on screen.

To install, download and run the exe, or download AHK to directly run the source code
